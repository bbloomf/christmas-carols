Possible script:
 add "\override VerticalAxisGroup #'staff-affinity = #0"
 to the \Lyrics context

 Get rid of \with clauses in Lyrics

reverse order of \new Lyrics directives

 remove all \dropLyrics commands...


(Sometimes \dropLyrics is used to center lyrics for choruses.  I am not sure how this will work with the staff-affinity = #0 line.)
