# Joy to the World

1.
Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King;
Let ev’ry heart prepare Him room,
And heav’n and nature sing,
And heav’n and nature sing,
And heav’n, and heav’n and nature sing.

2.
Joy to the world! the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

3.
No more let sin and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

4.
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders of His love.


# O Come All Ye Faithful

1.
O come, all ye faithful, Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him, Born the King of angels;

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

2.
God, of God, Light of Light,
Lo, He abhors not the Virgin’s womb;
Very God,
Begotten, not created:

3.
Sing, choirs of angels, Sing with exultations,
Sing, all ye citizens of heav’n above;
Glory to God, Glory in the highest;

4.
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to Thee be glory giv’n;
Word of the Father, Now in flesh appearing;


# O Little Town of Bethlehem

1.
O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

2.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And gather’d all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond’ring love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth!

3.
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is giv’n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His Heav’n.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin;
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

4.
Where children pure and happy
  pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to Thee,
  Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
  and faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
  and Christmas comes once more

5.
O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!


# Away in a Manger

1.
Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head:
The stars in the heavens
Look’d down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay.

2.
The cattle are lowing,
The poor baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus,
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle
Till morning is nigh.

3.
Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me, I pray:
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there.


# It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

1.
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
“Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heav’n’s all gracious King.”
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

2.
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurl’d;
And still their heav’nly music floats
O’er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hov’ring wing,
And ever o’er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

3.
O ye, beneath life’s crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow!
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

4.
For lo! the days are hast’ning on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the evercircling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When Peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.


# The First Noel

1.
The first Noël the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.

Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël,
Born is the King of Israel.

2.
They looked up and saw a Star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

3.
And by the light of that same Star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star where e’er it went.

4.
This star drew nigh to the North West,
O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

5.
Then enter’d in those Wisemen three,
Full rev’rently on bended knee,
And offer’d there in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

6.
Then let us all with one accord,
Sing praises to our Heavenly Lord,
That hath made Heav’n and earth of naught,
And with His Blood mankind hath bought.


# We Three Kings

1.
We three kings of Orient are;
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.

O Star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to Thy perfect light.

2.
Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain,
Gold I bring, to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never,
Over us all to reign.

3.
Frankincense to offer have I,
Incense owns a Deity nigh,
Pray’r and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God most High.

4.
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume,
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Seal’d in the stonecold tomb.

5.
Glorious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice,
Alleluia, Alleluia,
Earth to heav’n replies.


# Hark the Herald Angels Sing

1.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
“Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;
God and sinners reconciled.”
Joyful all ye nations, rise;
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th’angelic hosts proclaim,
“Christ is born in Bethlehem.”

Hark the herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King.

2.
Christ, by highest heav’n adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of the Virgin’s womb.
Veil’d in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th’Incarnate Deity,
Pleased as Man with man to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel!

3.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Ris’n with healing in His wings,
Light and life to all He brings,
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Hail, the heav’n born Prince of Peace!


# Silent Night

1.
Silent night!
Holy night!
All is calm,
all is bright.
Round yon Virgin
Mother and Child,
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

2.
Silent night!  Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heav’nly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ, the Savior is born!
Christ, the Savior is born!

3.
Silent night!  Holy night!
Son of God, love’s pure light!
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth!
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth!
